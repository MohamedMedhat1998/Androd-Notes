Putting a value in double quotes formats it as a String, which is more flexible in nature. 
Putting it as a standard number, i. e. id: 801 would not allow decimals, 
numbers outside the integer range, etc
//-----------------
Does that mean JSON Data doesn’t have any data type that holds decimal numbers?
like double or float in java
And it doesn’t have long for bigger numbers ?
//-----------------
JSON is a very basic formatting of data, and while the number data type can hold small floating points, 
the data types that are supported are only very high level, which are:

a string
a number
an object (JSON object)
an array
a boolean
null
