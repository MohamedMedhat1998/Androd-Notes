It is a stream of bytes that can be processed to get an image or other types of usually large data.
//-----------
Inputstream is an abstract class which allows you to read content from files in for of a stream (A stream is a sequence of data.)
It’s the sibling of OutStream which allows you to write content to a file.
It’s to note that inputStream can only read data in form of bytes, 
whereas an inputStreamReader which you also encounter in the video reads data in form of String.
//-----------
You have to think of a stream as an ordered flow of data that is transmitted 
//-----------
Think of a Stream as a channel through which pieces of data are broadcasted. 
If you are at the end which receives data, then you have an input stream. Otherwise, 
if you are at the end that sends data, you have an output stream
//-----------
It reads any type of data which is represented as bytes

Java has two kinds of classes for input and output (I/O): streams and readers/writers.
Streams (InputStream, OutputStream and everything that extends these) are for reading and writing binary data from files,
 the network, or whatever other device.
Readers and writers are for reading and writing text (characters). 
They are a layer on top of streams, that converts binary data (bytes) to characters and back, using a character encoding.
Reading data from disk byte-by-byte is very inefficient. 
One way to speed it up is to use a buffer: instead of reading one byte at a time, you read a few thousand bytes at once, 
and put them in a buffer, in memory. Then you can look at the bytes in the buffer one by one.
