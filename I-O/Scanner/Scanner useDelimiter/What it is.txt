Instead of reading line-by-line, 
you can read the entire contents of the file into a single string by using “\A” as the delimiter. 
This works because the delimiter \A is a boundary match for the beginning of input
as declard in java.util.regex.Pattern which is why Scanner is returing the entire
String from the InputStream.
In addition , in regular expressions, \\A is used to represent the start of a text.
So when we set the delimiter to \\A,
 we are forcing the scanner to get the contents of the file from very start.

scanner.useDelimiter("\\A");

//----------------------------
scanner.useDelimiter("\\A");
forces the scanner to read the contents of the file from the very start 
and hence will contain the entire data of the file, 
if you don’t use this then you can’t be sure if you are reading the entire file contents or not.
//-------------------
So , the function of the method “useDelimiter” is only forcing the scanner 
to read from the beginning in order not to lose any data?
Yes, precisely
Now when you call .next() on the scanner, 
it will return you the entire data from the start to the end!
