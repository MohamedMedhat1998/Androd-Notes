The Adapter requires us to
override three functions.
//------------------------
The first is onCreateViewHolder,

which is called when the RecyclerView
instantiates a new ViewHolder instance.

//-----------------------
The second is onBindViewHolder,

which is called when RecyclerView
wants to populate the view
with data from our model, so
that the user can see it, effectively
binding it to the data source.

//----------------------
And third is getItemCount, 
which returns
the number of items in our data source.
